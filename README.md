# Brian's dotfiles

Prerequisites: GNU Make in PATH

Installing

- `git clone git://github.com/bjenkinz/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `make`

`make` will symlink everything appropriately to the home directory

# Thanks

I originally forked Ryan McGeary's [dotfiles](https://github.com/rmm5t/dotfiles), 
but then got rid of a bunch of stuff and added some of my own.
